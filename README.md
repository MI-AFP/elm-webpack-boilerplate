# Elm Webpack Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate using webpack to build web application using [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com).

Use:

- `yarn dev` to start a dev server running on `localhost:8080`
- `yarn build` to build the production build into the `dist` folder

Format `js` and `ELM` code with [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format):

```
$ yarn format
```
